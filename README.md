This open-source game project aims to implement the game Hitting Ball using OpenCV and Machine Vision techniques. A rectangular surface is located at the bottom of the screen, which could be moved horizontally by moving the hand. There is a block array on top of the screen consisting of a couple of rectangles positioned beside each other. By moving the hand, the ball starts moving toward the blocks using reflection rules, and the player should destroy all the blocks while the ball does not hit the ground.
